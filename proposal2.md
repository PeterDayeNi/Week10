# Smart home remote control

App on Android that control the room light, air conditioner, clock and sort of things.

## Summary

Although there are few different kind of smart home control including google home, Amazon Echo, I still want to make my own smart home remote control.

My grandparents can only speak cantonese so they are not able to use all kind of smart home device. But they do can use smart phone or iPad. I want to help them to enjoy the convenience of smart home.

I may work on Java.

## Component Parts

I am still thinking. But I would like to made a menu to control each of the electrical equipment. In each part of it, there is an on/off switch.
